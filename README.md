Abstract:
The murine epidermis harbors two key resident immune populations—Langerhans cells (LCs) and dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs)—which play critical roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis, immune surveillance, and barrier integrity. Although their origin from fetal progenitors have been defined, the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing their postnatal maturation upon colonisation of the epidermis around birth remain incompletely understood. Here, we present an imaging- and transcriptome-resolved single-cell roadmap of LC and DETC maturation in the murine epidermis from late embryogenesis through adulthood. We identify distinct, progressive maturation trajectories for both cell types, marked by coordinated changes in morphology, proliferation, and transcriptional programming. Using mice deficient for bona fide DETCs, we demonstrate that LC maturation occurs independently of DETCs. Moreover, analysis of germ-free and wildling mice reveals that the postnatal development of both LCs and DETCs is independent of microbial colonization. Together, our findings define the fundamental developmental principles underlying the establishment of the murine epidermal immune niche.
